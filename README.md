# Michael_Kogan_Ayal_Cohen_Project
Final Project in OOP 2021.

Java program using OOP with JavaFX MVC architectural pattern.

A company program that allows you to add new departments/roles/employees.
If you add an employee to an existing position he will be automatically added to a department the position belongs.
The program calculates the preferences of the employees and the departments and what will be the efficiency level of the department.

Knows issues - The program crushes when you add a new employee to a new role.
